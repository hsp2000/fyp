Personality prediction system through analyzing CV’s

While there are already existing systems that scan through CV’s and shortlist them considering the necessary technical expertise and skills needed for the job, there is no current method of getting an idea about whether the candidate is a fit for the job personality wise. Most often this is evaluated at the later stage in interviews where a manager will vet the candidate. As personality is just as important as skills when it comes to being the right fit for a job, it would be highly beneficial in the process of hiring if there was an automated way of extracting the candidates personality through scanning their CV.

How it will work:
Job seekers as well as recruiters will be able to register with the system and provide their details.
Recruiters will be able to list job opportunities as well as the main skills and personality traits that are essential for that role.
Candidates are allowed to submit their CV portfolios to the relevant roles they wish to apply for.
The system will automatically vet the CVs against job requirements ranging from skill to personality and will give the result of compatibility as a percentage for each skill/personality trait needed for the job.
Recruiters are then able to vet the results and decide which of the candidates that are shortlisted will proceed in the hiring process to interviews wtc.
The system will most likely be built using neural networks

The advantages of this system would be:
Making the hiring process much faster.
Human intervention in the hiring process will be minimized saving time and resources.
Companies will find it much easier to hire candidates that fit their company culture and work goals.
The current competitors in the market such as Smart Recruiters ( though they don't exactly provide the function of personality screening) are quite costly, this solution has the possibility of being available at a much lower cost or for free.
